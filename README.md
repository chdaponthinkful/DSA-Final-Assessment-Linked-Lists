# 1.3.10 DSA-Final-Assessment-Linked-Lists

Data structures: Linked lists
To succeed at this challenge, you'll need to demonstrate that you can implement the following:

A complete Queue using only a LinkedList
An algorithm to delete all duplicate values from a sorted linked list
A complete Stack using only a LinkedList
A Parking Lot that uses a Queue when the lot is full
An algorithm to check if a string is a palindrome using a Stack
You will not need to make any edits to HTML or CSS for this project.

Tasks
Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assessment.

In the src/linked-list/queue.js file, implement a complete Queue using only a LinkedList.
In the src/removeDuplicates.js file, implement an algorithm to delete all duplicate values from a sorted linked list. Values may be numbers or strings.
In the src/linked-list/stack.js file, implement a complete Stack using only a LinkedList.
In the src/queue/parkingLot.js file, implement a Parking Lot that uses a Queue when the lot is full.
In the src/stack/isPalindrome.js file, implement an algorithm to check if a string is a palindrome using a Stack.
Once these tasks are complete, all tests should pass.
